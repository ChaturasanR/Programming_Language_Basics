### Supported Types

- Primitivite Types
  - byte (size: 1 bytes, represents number)
  - short (size: 2 bytes, represents number)
  - int (size: 4 bytes, represents number)
  - long (size: 8 bytes, represents number)
  - float (size: 4 bytes, represents decimal numbers)
  - double (size: 8 bytes, represents decimal numbers)
  - char (size: 2 bytes, represents character)
  - boolean (size: 1 byte, represents true/false)
- Reference Types (References to Objects)

Primitive types directly store the value while reference type store the memory location where actual object is stored. And Java is a pass by value language
